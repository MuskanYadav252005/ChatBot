# ChatBot
Chatpaata is a full-stack chatbot developed for a food delivery system, showcasing the integration of natural language processing with real-time backend and database logic.

This project demonstrates the complete development lifecycle of a conversational assistant — from building intelligent dialogue flows in Dialogflow to managing real-time user requests via a Python FastAPI backend, and storing order data using MySQL.

It includes:

🧠 Dialogflow fundamentals: intents, entities, contexts, and fulfillment

⚙️ Webhook backend using FastAPI to handle custom logic and API responses

🗄️ Integration with a MySQL database for order tracking and history

💬 Embedded chatbot interface using Dialogflow Messenger

🌐 Deployment on Netlify for live access

This project is a practical demonstration of how AI-driven chat interfaces can connect with real business logic and data, making it a strong portfolio piece for AI, ML, or backend-focused roles.
